This Python script utilizes the matplotlib library to create high-quality scientific plots similar to those produced in Origin.
The code allows you to fine-tune the appearance of the plot, including figure size, axes, labels and font. Rectangular or square figure formats are presented.
My_Rectangular_Graph.py plots figure with "rectangular" format. My_Square_Graph.py plots figure with "square" format. allows you to fine-tune the appearance of the plot, including figure size, axes, labels and font.    
You may also use the two predefined configuration style files, My_Rectangular_Fig.mplstyle and My_Square_Fig.mplstyle, to be placed into the matplotlib library (...\matplotlib\mpl-data\stylelib). 
These configurations automatically apply specific styles and transformations to the plot figures. These files are associated with the codes My_Rectangular_Graph_beta.py and My_Square_Graph_beta.py.   
The script Figure_3.py gives an example of plot published in arXiv preprint arXiv:2010.06051.
